; Tip
; When you define coding conventions in an EditorConfig file, you're configuring how you want the code style analyzers 
; that are built into Visual Studio to analyze your code. 
; The EditorConfig file is the configuration file for these analyzers.

; Be **careful** editing this because some of the rules don't support adding a severity level
; For instance if you change to `dotnet_sort_system_directives_first = true:warning` (adding `:warning`)
; then the rule will be silently ignored.

; Remove the line below if you want to inherit .editorconfig settings from higher directories
